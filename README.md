**SWAT** (short for SW.ift A.ctive T.emplates) will be a Swift-based templating engine that can be used to automate dynamic file generation for a variety of use cases and integrations. Possible use cases could include generation of:

- Header files
- Language- and/or configuration files
- Documentation
- Static websites

Please note that this is yet a _very_ early prototype and that it currently does none of those things mentioned above in any reliable way.


## Requirements

- macOS (any version w/ installed Swift toolchain)


## Usage

That's the neat thing, you don't; it's currently at the "has hardcoded file paths" stage of prototyping. Instructions will be coming as soon as it's near a pre-alpha stage.


## License

SWAT is released under the AGPL-3.0 license. [See LICENSE](https://github.com/mvanallen/Swat/blob/master/LICENSE) for details.
